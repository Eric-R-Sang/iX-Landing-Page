                <p>Some things about me:</p>
                <p>As of right now, I just finished my second year at Vanderbilt as a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics major with a minor in Business.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I like to play the guitar, listen to new music, go to the gym, watch anime/read manga, and eat a lot of food. I also recently picked up reading again, and I enjoy reading fiction (East of Eden by John Steinbeck) and philosophy (Human, All Too Human by Nietzsche).</p>
                <p>I also really love the outdoors, and on nice days, you can catch me fishing, hammocking, or hiking!</p>
